## About Us

**CABROCHICO** is a punk-rock group known for their energetic and vibrant performances. Formed in 2021, the band consists of two guitars, a bass, a drummer, and three vocalists, all originally from Latin America and residing in Lille, France.

### Our Journey

**CABROCHICO** was born out of the friendship and shared passion for music of Hugo Correa and Carlos Puentes. While working long shifts, they seized their free time to create songs and experiment with new sounds. Shortly after, Cristian Garrido joined the group as the second guitarist and vocalist, adding vocal harmonies. Gabriel Moreno completed the lineup by joining as the bassist and vocalist. The current lineup was finalized with David Crespo on drums, replacing Carlos when he had to return to Chile.

### Our DIY Commitment

**CABROCHICO** is a 100% DIY (Do It Yourself) group. Over the past two years, we have independently released two EPs and a music video. We are committed to self-production and creative control of our work, while working towards professionalizing our group.

### The Meaning Behind Our Name

**CABROCHICO** comes from a Chilean expression and means "the child within us" to us. This name reflects our youthful, fun, and carefree spirit, which is reflected both in our music and our attitude on stage and in life.

### Our Music

Influenced by skate-surf-punk-rock and internet memes, all of our songs are original and in Spanish. Our style is a unique blend of energy and fun, ensuring that both we and our audience enjoy every performance to the fullest.

In 2021, we released our first EP with 3 songs. In 2022, we published "Charlie Brownie," our first entirely self-produced album. In 2023, we released "Revenga!", produced by Milo from Huhok in Barcelona. These releases have been significant milestones in our musical journey.

### Live Performances

**CABROCHICO**'s energy truly shines in our live concerts. We have performed on the local scene in northern France. Each show is an opportunity to connect with our audience in a unique and powerful way.

### What's Next

The future of **CABROCHICO** looks bright. We are working on new songs and preparing exciting projects. We are excited to share our music with the world and to continue growing as artists and as a band.

What makes **CABROCHICO** special is our history and how we came together. What started as a way to pass time between work shifts has evolved into an exciting career and a life mission. Each member of the band brings something unique, and together, we are creating something that goes beyond music.
